Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[1][2][b] Ronaldo holds the record for most goals and assists in the UEFA Champions League (140 and 42 respectively), and the record for most goals in the UEFA European Championship (14), its qualification stage (31), and the FIFA Club World Cup (7), as well as most goals scored in a UEFA Champions League season (17), most international goals (115), and most appearances in a European national team (180). He has scored a record 812 senior career goals for club and country. Moreover, he is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances.
